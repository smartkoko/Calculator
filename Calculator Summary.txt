Summary
=======

Overall using recursive method
1)Check the expression contain brackets or not, if yes then get the inner bracket's expression for calculation first else proceed to step 2.
2)Calculate the expression by checking the operator's priority first which is "*/" first then only "+-".
3)After calculate then replace the answer to the expression to become a new expression.
4)Continue step 1,2,3 until no more operators occur in the expression which mean it is the answer of the expression.
